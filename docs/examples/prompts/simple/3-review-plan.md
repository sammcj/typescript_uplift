# Development Plan Review

I'm planning to perform an uplift of the code quality in my project.

I want you to review the DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md document I've created.

- Look for any errors, contradictory statements or misaligned tasks - but don't nitpick.
- Value actionable items over specific code changes.

If you identify any serious concerns or changes that need to be made, please provide a concise summary of your recommended changes otherwise just confirm that the plan looks good to you.
