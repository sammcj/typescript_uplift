# Development Plan Creation

Create a new markdown file called DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md with context relevant to the findings, requirements and recommendations we've discussed today.

- Provide enough context that I could hand the document to an engineer to execute along with the codebase without further explanation.
- Keep your writing concise and focus on actionable high descriptions rather than specific code changes.
- Add a **checklist of development tasks to complete the work in phases**.
- The tasks should be concise, clear, actionable and kept to a high level, with no more than 5-8 tasks per phase.
- At the end of each phase add three tasks:
  1. "Perform a critical self review of the work completed in this phase, fixing any issues found."
  2. "Mark any tasks you've completed to 100% off in the plan"
  3. "The final task should be "STOP and wait for human review"

Then stop for me to review.
