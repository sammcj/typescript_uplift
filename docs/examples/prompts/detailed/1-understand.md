# Reviewing an existing codebase

I want you to undertake a high level review of the existing code in this project.

- Identify any serious code quality issues, anti patterns or areas where the code could be improved.
- Check for any package versions that are out of date.

Then I want you to provide a concise summary of your findings along with a list of the top 5-10 issues that should be addressed.

Keep your recommendations high level rather than going into specific code changes.
