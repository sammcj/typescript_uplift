# Enterprise Inventory Management System

A simple TypeScript web application with basic functionality for an inventory management system.

There are quite a few problems with the code as it currently stands - it could use some updates, refactoring and improvements.

## Setup

```
npm install
```

## Running the App

```
npm run dev
```

This will build the app, copy necessary files, and start a local server. You can then open the provided URL (usually http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Testing

```
npm test
```

## Test Coverage

```
npm run test:coverage
```

## Linting

```
npm run lint
```

## Notes

- Supports i18n (currently only en-US)
